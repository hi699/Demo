# Introduction To Git
  ## What is Git?
    1) It is developed in 2005.
    2) It is a version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects.
    3) Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained 
       record of your ongoing programming versions. It can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service — you don’t 
       even need internet access, except to download it.
